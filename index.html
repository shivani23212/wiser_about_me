            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Between being a university student, helping out at home during the holidays and attending career, 
                    charity and friends&#39; events&#44; I look forward to the variety every day and season of the year brings&#44;
                    since I believe you can&#8217;t grow without change!</p>

                <p>Although each day provides a new challenge, I do enjoy including several staple 
                    activities in my daily routine to remain motivated, grounded and content. 
                    As you will discover, these include hobbies (such as strength training, learning 
                    the ukulele or reading), learning (be this through lectures or study sessions with 
                    my friends) and ensuring I am looking after my mental and physical health through 
                    sleeping and eating right.</p>

                <p>Below I have outlined how an average day might pan out 	&#8211; depending on my location
                    and how packed my schedule is!</p>

                    <h3>A day at Uni</h3>
                    <p>I wake up, get ready (pray, shower, brush my teeth etc) and check my diary. My first 
                        lecture&#8217;s scheduled at 9:00am &#8211; it&#8217;s currently 7:15am and I have some time. I quickly 
                        make a packed breakfast, lunch (don&#8217;t forget the coffee!), pack my bag for the 
                        day and head out to the gym. After a quick session it&#8217;s now 8:40am and I head to 
                        campus for the lecture then go to the library to consolidate and revise for the upcoming 
                        test. After this I apply to a couple of internships, complete any admin needed and check 
                        my diary for tomorrow (in case of any upcoming events I need to prepare for tonight), at 
                        around 5pm I make my way to meet my friends from Hindu Society and unwind by the best 
                        means &#8211; gossip! By 7pm I&#8217;m home and I either work a bit more on coursework or video call 
                        my family before watching YouTube with some dinner. At around 10:30pm I get ready for bed 
                        and go to sleep!</p>

                <div class="day">
                    <h3>A day at Home</h3>
                    <p>Since these days would be during a period when I have no university deadlines â€“ they would
                         be more relaxed. I would wake up at around 8:00am &#8211; (still) check my diary for any 
                         upcoming meetings through the day, then head to the local leisure centre at 8:45am. After a 
                         strength session I head to the cafe where I grab a coffee and work &#8211; either on a 
                         personal programming project (currently &#8211; this website) or on a couple of technical 
                         interview questions. I&#8217;m home by 2pm and I have some lunch, accompanied by either a 
                         friend or Netflix. If it&#8217;s a tutoring day &#8211; I leave by 3:30pm to arrive at the tutoring 
                         centre by 3:45pm. The sessions usually last around 2.5 hours so I&#8217;m back home at 6pm. I 
                         then relax by learning a couple more lines on the ukulele and spend some time with my family. 
                         After dinner, I go to sleep at around 12:00am &#8211; looking forward to the next day.</p>

                    <h3>Organisation</h3>
                    <p>Since I enjoy a range of activities throughout the day &#8211; I keep myself in check using my (sacred) 
                        diary. In this I write up the timings of any lectures, society meetings, one-off 
                        commitments and planned events for the day. I usually enter in these commitments during 
                        the weekend to make sure I am organised for the upcoming week. In this diary I also note 
                        down any assignments due &#8211; and write up touchpoints on certain days (such as 4 weeks before 
                        due date, 2 weeks before, 3 days before and so on) to ensure I am on track with submitting 
                        my work.
